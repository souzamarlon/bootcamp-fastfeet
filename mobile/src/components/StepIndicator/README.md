The Step indicator component was develop by 24ark (https://github.com/24ark/react-native-step-indicator).

I just copied the component because React was giving following warning: "Warning: componentWillReceiveProps has been renamed, and is not recommended for use. See https://fb.me/react-async-component-lifecycle-hooks for details."
It has a issue open in them repository but they didnt update yet. Issue: https://github.com/24ark/react-native-step-indicator/issues/78

So I just copied them component to fix this warning which it was annoying.


Thank you!
